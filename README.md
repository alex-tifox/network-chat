# Network chat
Simple network chat, written on Java with common UI.

## How does it work?
When server part is running allowed to run as many UI as possible and it will be the next user of the chat.
Technologies: Java 8, Sockets

## How to run
There are no jar applications yet. 
Steps to run the app:
1. Clone the repo
2. Configure your IP address and port at 'ClientWindow.java'
3. Start server part in your IDE, 
4. Start client part, or connect directly through Putty for example. 
5. Good! That's working! (Probably like you want :D)

## Further functionality - WIP
- User authorization
- Chat history
- Server complete start - availability to start the chat server by your own with no coding
- Complete UI bundle to connect to any available chat - on desktop (Java UI) and in the web (ReactJS)
